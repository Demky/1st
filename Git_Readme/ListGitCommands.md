TODO (format ยง) : 
> There are also tools that offer graphical interfaces to compare the differences of versions of a file :
* imdiff 
* meld
* opendiff
* kdiff3
* tkdiff
* xxdiff
* tortoisemerge
* gvimdiff
* diffuse
* ecmerge
* p4merge
* araxis 
* emerge

Launch one of these external merge tools with the git mergetool command as : 
> git mergetool vimdiff
